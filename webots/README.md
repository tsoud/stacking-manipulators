<h2><b>Webots Simulator Information</b></h2>
Author: Tamer Abousoud<br><br>


This project uses the open source simulator [Webots](https://cyberbotics.com/) for defining the robots and creating the test environment. The latest version of Webots can be downloaded from https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases/tag/R2021b. This directory contains the robot models and environment (world) files for the Webots simulation. The structure of this directory follows the recommended structure for Webots projects as outlined [here](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-1-your-first-simulation-in-webots).

Please note that an earlier release of Webots was used for this project (R2021a). It has not been tested yet on the latest R2021b release.
